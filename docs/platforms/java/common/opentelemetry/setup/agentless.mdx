If our recommended <PlatformLink to="/opentelemetry/agent">Java Agent approach</PlatformLink> isn't for you, we have a separate dependency for this use case.

## Install

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-install/without-java-agent" />

## Usage

You'll have to configure both OpenTelemetry and Sentry to see transactions in Sentry and have errors linked to transactions created by OpenTelemetry.
