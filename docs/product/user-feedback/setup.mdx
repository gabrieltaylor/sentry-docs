With User Feedback, you can collect feedback from your users via three methods: a Feedback Widget that can be displayed anywhere in your web application, an API that can attach to your own interface, or a Crash-Report Modal that appears when your users are experiencing crashes.

To get instructions for how to set it up and start collecting feedback, click a link for one of the supported SDKs below.

## Supported SDKs for User Feedback Widget

The User Feedback widget can be used on all browser-based applications. This includes static websites, single-page-applications, and also server-side-rendered, including frameworks such as:
[Django](/platforms/python/integrations/django/),
[Spring](/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/),
[ASP.NET](/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnetcore/),
[Laravel](/platforms/php/guides/laravel/),
[Express](/platforms/javascript/guides/express/) and
[Rails](/platforms/ruby/guides/rails/).
If you don't use `npm` or `yarn`, you can use [our Loader `script` tag](/platforms/javascript/install/loader/) on your main HTML template.

The Sentry SDK that injects the Feedback widget runs on the client's browser, and itâ€™s built-in to `@sentry/browser` and our browser framework SDKs:

- [Vanilla JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/user-feedback/)
- [Angular](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/user-feedback/)
- [Astro](/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/user-feedback/)
- [Capacitor](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/user-feedback/)
- [Electron](/platforms/javascript/guides/electron/user-feedback/)
- [Ember](/platforms/javascript/guides/ember/user-feedback/)
- [Gatsby](/platforms/javascript/guides/gatsby/user-feedback/)
- [Next.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/user-feedback/)
- [React](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/user-feedback/)
- [Remix](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/user-feedback/)
- [Svelte](/platforms/javascript/guides/svelte/user-feedback/)
- [SvelteKit](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/user-feedback/)
- [Vue](/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/user-feedback/)

## Supported SDKs for User Feedback API

We also provide an API to send user feedback programmatically. This allows you to connect your own user interface with Sentry User Feedback. The following SDKs are supported:

- [Android](/platforms/android/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Apple](/platforms/apple/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Dart](/platforms/dart/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Flutter](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Java](/platforms/java/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Kotlin](/platforms/kotlin/guides/kotlin-multiplatform/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Node.JS](/platforms/javascript/guides/node/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [React Native](/platforms/react-native/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Unreal](/platforms/unreal/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)

If your platform is not supported, you may post data to the [Web API](https://docs.sentry.io/api/projects/submit-user-feedback/).
