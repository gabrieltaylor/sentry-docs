The BatchProcessor batches spans and logs into one envelope to reduce the number of HTTP requests. When an SDK implements span streaming or logs, it MUST use a BatchProcessor, which is similar to [OpenTelemetry's Batch Processors](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/processor/batchprocessor/README.md). The BatchProcessor holds finished spans and logs in memory and batches them together in envelopes. It uses a combination of time and size-based batching. When writing this, the BatchProcessor only handles spans and logs, but the SDK MAY use it for other telemetry data in the future.

## Specification

Whenever the SDK finishes a span or captures a log, it MUST put these into the BatchProcessor. The SDK MUST NOT put unfinished spans into the BatchProcessor. The BatchProcessor MUST start a timeout of `x` seconds when the SDK adds the first span or log. When the timeout exceeds, the BatchProcessor MUST send all spans or logs, no matter how many items it contains. The BatchProcessor MUST send all items after the SDK captures spans or logs with a size more than `y`. When the BatchProcessor sends all spans or logs, it MUST reset its timeout and remove all spans and logs. The SDK MUST apply filtering and sampling before adding spans or logs to the BatchProcessor. The SDK SHOULD drop rate limited spans and logs before putting them into the BatchProcessor to reduce memory usage.

The SDK MUST calculate the size of a span or a log to manage the BatchProcessor's memory footprint. The SDK MUST serialize the span or log and calculate the size based on the serialized JSON bytes. As serialization is expensive, the BatchProcessor SHOULD keep track of the serialized spans and logs and pass these to the envelope to avoid serializing multiple times.

The detailed specification is written in the [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) and uses `x = 10` seconds for the timeout and `y = 1024 * 1024` for the maximum batch byte size in the BatchProcessor. SDKs MAY use different values for `x` and `y` depending on their needs. The SDK SHOULD NOT expose x and y via the options. The specification uses spans as an example, but the same applies to logs or any other future telemetry data.


```Gherkin
Scenario: No spans in BatchProcessor 1 span added
    Given no spans in the BatchProcessor
    When the SDK finishes 1 span
    Then the SDK puts this span to the BatchProcessor
    And starts a timeout of 10 seconds
    And doesn't send the span to Sentry

Scenario: Span added before timeout exceeds
    Given span A in the BatchProcessor
    Given 9.9 seconds pass
    When the SDK finishes span B
    Then the SDK adds span B to the BatchProcessor
    And doesn't reset the timeout
    And doesn't send the spans A and B in the BatchProcessor to Sentry

Scenario: Spans with size of y - 1 added, timeout exceeds
    Given spans with size of y - 1 in the BatchProcessor
    When the timeout exceeds
    Then the SDK adds all the spans to one envelope
    And sends them to Sentry
    And resets the timeout
    And clears the BatchProcessor

Scenario: Spans with size of y added within 9.9 seconds
    Given spans with size of y - 1 in the BatchProcessor
    When the SDK finishes another span and puts it into the BatchProcessor
    Then the BatchProcessor puts all spans into one envelope
    And sends the envelope to Sentry
    And resets the timeout
    And clears the BatchProcessor

Scenario: Unfinished spans
    Given no span is in the BatchProcessor
    When the SDK starts a span but doesn't finish it
    Then the BatchProcessor is empty

Scenario: Span filtered out
    Given no span is in the BatchProcessor
    When the finishes a span
    And the span is filtered out
    Then the BatchProcessor is empty

Scenario: Span not sampled
    Given no span is in the BatchProcessor
    When the finishes a span
    And the span is not sampled
    Then the BatchProcessor is empty

Scenario: 1 span added application crashes
  Given 1 span in the SpansAggregator
  When the SDK detects a crash
  Then the SDK does nothing with the items in the BatchProcessor
  And loses the spans in the BatchProcessor
